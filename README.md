# Leasing-Agent-Workflow-Automation-Marketing-AI
 leasing agent automate their workflow and develop an effective social media marketing strategy. The ideal candidate will leverage Artificial Intelligence tools to streamline processes, save time, and increase lead generation. If you have experience in real estate marketing, automation tools, and social media strategy, we want to hear from you. Your expertise will play a crucial role in enhancing our lead acquisition and overall efficiency in the leasing process.
------------
To help a leasing agent automate their workflow and develop an effective social media marketing strategy using Python and AI, here’s how you can approach the project:
Key Features of the Automation and Marketing Strategy:

    Lead Generation & Management:
        Use AI tools to automatically capture leads, manage interactions, and classify them based on urgency, property preferences, etc.

    Social Media Marketing Automation:
        Automate the posting schedule for listings, property tours, and promotional content on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn.

    Customer Relationship Management (CRM):
        Build a CRM to manage potential tenants, track interactions, send reminders, and engage prospects through automated emails or messages.

    AI-Powered Content:
        Generate social media content using AI (e.g., creating engaging posts or using NLP tools to create personalized responses).

Proposed Tech Stack and Tools:

    Frontend: React.js (for any dashboard or web-based app interface)
    Backend: Flask or Django (for serving APIs)
    AI Tools: OpenAI for content generation, Scikit-learn or TensorFlow for lead classification and segmentation.
    Social Media APIs: Facebook Graph API, Instagram Graph API for automation
    Database: PostgreSQL/MongoDB for managing leads and customer information

Python Code Implementation for Lead Generation and Automation
1. Lead Capturing & Classification (Classifying Leads Based on Priorities)

You can use a simple classifier to segment leads based on the type of inquiry, urgency, or property preference.

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

# Sample lead data (Textual Inquiry, Priority Level)
data = {'inquiry': ['Looking for 2 bedroom apartment in city center',
                    'Is this property still available?',
                    'I am looking for a 1 bedroom apartment with parking',
                    'Interested in leasing for next 6 months'],
        'priority': ['High', 'Low', 'Medium', 'High']}

# Convert data into DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert text data into numerical representation
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['inquiry'])
y = df['priority']

# Split the dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train a Naive Bayes classifier
classifier = MultinomialNB()
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict priority for a new lead
new_lead = ['I need a 2 bedroom apartment with a view']
new_lead_vectorized = vectorizer.transform(new_lead)
predicted_priority = classifier.predict(new_lead_vectorized)

print("Predicted Priority Level:", predicted_priority[0])

2. Social Media Post Automation (Posting Property Listings)

Using the Instagram Graph API and Facebook Graph API, you can automate the process of posting listings to social media. Below is an example of how you might use Python to post content on Instagram.

Install the necessary libraries:

pip install requests

Example Code to Post an Image to Instagram:

import requests

# Instagram API endpoint to post an image
access_token = 'your-instagram-access-token'
image_url = 'https://example.com/property-image.jpg'
caption = 'New Property Listing: 2 Bedroom apartment in the city center. DM for details! #RealEstate #ForRent'

url = f"https://graph.instagram.com/me/media?image_url={image_url}&caption={caption}&access_token={access_token}"

response = requests.post(url)
data = response.json()

# Once the media object is created, publish the post
creation_id = data['id']
publish_url = f"https://graph.instagram.com/{creation_id}/publish?access_token={access_token}"

publish_response = requests.post(publish_url)
print(publish_response.json())

3. CRM Automation (Sending Automatic Emails to Leads)

Use Python’s smtplib to send automatic emails to new leads, notifying them about available properties.

import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart

def send_email(subject, body, to_email):
    sender_email = "your-email@gmail.com"
    sender_password = "your-email-password"

    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['From'] = sender_email
    msg['To'] = to_email
    msg['Subject'] = subject

    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))

    # Establish connection with Gmail's SMTP server
    server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
    server.starttls()
    server.login(sender_email, sender_password)

    # Send email
    text = msg.as_string()
    server.sendmail(sender_email, to_email, text)
    server.quit()

# Example: Send automatic email to a lead
send_email("New Property Listing", "Hi, we have a new 2 bedroom apartment available for lease in your area.", "lead@example.com")

4. AI-Powered Content Generation (Using OpenAI for Post and Response Generation)

import openai

# OpenAI API key setup
openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'

def generate_social_media_post(prompt):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
      engine="text-davinci-003",
      prompt=prompt,
      max_tokens=100
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example: Generate a social media post for a property listing
prompt = "Write a catchy social media post for a 2-bedroom apartment for rent in downtown with a balcony."
generated_post = generate_social_media_post(prompt)
print(generated_post)

Integrating AI into the Workflow:

    Lead Management: Capture new leads from your website or email using APIs and classify them based on urgency.
    CRM Integration: Automatically send emails to leads and store their information for follow-ups.
    Social Media Marketing: Schedule and automatically post property listings using Instagram and Facebook APIs, and generate engaging content with OpenAI’s GPT.
    Data Insights: Analyze user engagement, feedback, and trends to adjust social media strategies and content.

Final Thoughts:

This Python-based system will allow a leasing agent to:

    Automate lead qualification and prioritize based on urgency.
    Automatically post property listings and promotions across social media platforms.
    Use AI for content creation and email automation to improve marketing effectiveness and reduce manual tasks.

This system can evolve with more advanced AI tools for personalized marketing, chatbots, and integration with property management systems.
